The World Of Instant Noodles - By Owen Chan

Differences from Planning:
- Instead of scrolling from left to right in the noodle page, I stuck to only scrolling from up to down.

- I also added headers for the different types of noodles

- I made it so when you clicked onto the different noodles, it leads you to a seperate page with cooking instructions and descriptions.
