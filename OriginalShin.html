        <h2>Description</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="flexbox-grid">
        <p>Shin Ramyun Light is a lighter, healthier version of the iconic Shin Ramyun, designed for those who want to enjoy the bold, spicy flavors of the original but with fewer calories and less sodium. It’s perfect for health-conscious individuals or anyone looking for a slightly milder and more balanced instant noodle experience.

            The dish features the same signature chewy noodles as the original Shin Ramyun, but the broth and seasoning are adjusted to reduce calories and sodium content. The broth is still savory and flavorful, with a spicy kick, but it’s less intense and more approachable. The seasoning packets include a mix of spices, dehydrated vegetables, and a lighter seasoning base, ensuring a satisfying taste without the heaviness.
            
            Shin Ramyun Light retains the essence of the original—spicy, savory, and comforting—but with a cleaner, lighter profile. It’s a great option for those who want to enjoy the classic Shin Ramyun experience while being mindful of their dietary intake.
            
            This version is versatile and can be customized with additional healthy toppings like boiled eggs, spinach, mushrooms, or tofu to make it even more nutritious. Whether you’re looking for a quick meal or a lighter snack, Shin Ramyun Light delivers the beloved flavors of Shin Ramyun in a more health-conscious package!</p>

    <div class="flexbox-grid">
        <ul>
            <li>Pour 550 ml of water into a pot and bring it to a boil.</li>  
            <li>Once the water is boiling, add the noodles from the Shin Ramyun pack. Let the noodles cook for about 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they become soft and chewy.</li>
            <li>Open the seasoning packets (usually one powder packet and one vegetable/flake packet) and add them to the pot. Stir well to dissolve the seasoning and distribute the flavors evenly.</li>
            <li>Transfer the noodles into a bowl, ready to be served.</li>
